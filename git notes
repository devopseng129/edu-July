Solution provided by a version control system(VCS)/source code managment system(SCM):
- A developer will be able to manage or track changes to the code.
- When multiple developer works have to work simulteneously , they will be able to contribute to final code.
- who made changes in code base
- To manage older versions of application code.

what is a version control system:
---------------------------------
- A system that documents all changes made ina file or a set of files.
- multiple revisions of files can be managed.
- mutiple files from multiple users.

Type of a version control system:
----------------------------------
1. Local version control system:
- 1 to 1 interaction between developer and lvcs

challenges:
- It does not guarantee safety of your code(single point of failure)
- Multiple developers working parallely was not not possible.

2. Centralised version control system
- Multiple developers are working together.
eg: CVS, Subversion, perforce, TFS
challenges:
- Developers should always be connected over network
- Server had a single point of failure.

3. Distributed version control system
- This system is distributed in nature
- All developers can collabarate in development.
eg: github, mercurial, gitlab, bitbucket, butkeeper, Bazzar etc.


what is GIT?
--------------
- Its an open source software developed by Linus Torvalds.
- Distributed VCS
- Tool which tracks all changes which you have done in your code/files.
- working directory: Directory whre all your code files are present
- Staging area: Its a virtual area which acts as a buffer before you push code to local repository
- local repository: Its a repository which contains all commited code.


Github:
---------
It is a website where we host all our git codes.


scenrio1: Create a working directory
> mkdir git-demo-1252024
> cd git-demo-1252024


Scenerio2: Git installation
ubuntu:
--------
> apt-get update
> apt-get install git -y

Centos/RHEL
> yum install git -y
> git --version

windows:
https://git-scm.com/download/win


scenerio 3:
initialise/configure local repository in working directory

git init

git config --global user.email test@email.com
git config --global user.name test


scenerio4: create a file and add it to local repository

> vi testfile 
> esc :wq
> git status
> git add testfile
> git status
> git commit -m "1st commit"
> git ls-files

scenerio 5: ids to commit
git log --oneline
git show <commit id>
git log


scentio 6: checking staged and unstaged changes
git diff <filename> ==> command to check changes made in file when file is in working directory
git diff --staged testfile ==> command to check changes made in file when file is in staging area.

scenerio 7: Deletion of file:
how to delete a file from wd and local repo
> git rm testfile
how to delete a file from local repo only
> git rm --cached testfile


scenerio 8: Ignoring files: 
vi .gitignore
*.class
temp
git add .gitinore
git commit 


scenetio 9: Revert changes in git
git revert commit id

scenerio 10: reset
git reset commit id --hard

scenerio 11: Create your github account

scenerio: 12: Branching

> We can have multiple child branch but only one branch either master or main can deploy code to production environment.
> It helps in parallel development.
> Scope of development varies across brabches.
> git branch b1 master
> git checkout b1
> switched to b1 branch
> vi sample3.txt
> git add ; git commit
> git checkout master
> git merge b1 master


scenerio 13:
Resolving merge conflicts
> Made changes in same file in 2  branches, while merge we get conflicts and to resolve conflict,edit file and modify with necessary changes.
> After you modify, add and commit to resolve conflicts.

scenerio 14: Delete a branch
git branch -D b1

# Stashing : It is a git feature to hide incomplete work/development.
git stash ==> stashes/hides all files in working directory
git stash pop ==> brings all file from stashing area back to working dir

git stash -p ==> partial stashing
git stash drop <stashnumber> ==> to retrieve one file at a time

git stash pop ==> It brings stashed file back to working directory and clears stashing area
git stash apply ==> It brings stashed file back to working directory and does not clear stashing area


scenerio 14: Working with remote repository
git clone <repository url>  ==> execute to create full copy of remote repo in my local
git push originmain # origin is a variable point to remote repo url

scenerio 15:
git developer token

scenerio 16:
git pull is used to pull updated code from remote to local

scenerio 17:
git fetch will just show what will be pulled when pull command is executed
pull=fetch+merge
